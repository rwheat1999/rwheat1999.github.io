			<p>Hello. My name is Roger Wheat and welcome to my ePortfolio. I am an 18 year old high school senior at Armstrong Jr./Sr. High School. I am graduation in June of 2018 and from there I will move onto further my education at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg for my freshman and sophomore years. After that, for my Junior and Senior years of college, I will transfer to the University of Pittsburgh main campus in Oakland with my intended major being Information Technology. My hobbies include cooking, running, computers, and music. I am very involved in my music program at my school and have been for the past nine years. I play the Euphonium in my schools concert and marching bands. I have been playing the Euphonium since the fourth grade and I plan on continuing to play throughout the rest of my life. I am a very strong player and marcher and have won awards for both. I have won the Murphy's Music Award for playing ability and leadership, I have won an award for best underclassman marcher by freshman year, and I have been chosen as a section leader by my music director in tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade. I am a very hard worker when it comes to either playing in a concert band or marching and will always give help or tips to any underclassman that may need them.
